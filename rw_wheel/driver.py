# rw_wheel/driver.py
"""
Core driver for the RW4-12 Reaction Wheel.

This module implements the low-level Nanosatellite Protocol (NSP)
as specified in the E400281 RW4-12 Software ICD document. It handles
SLIP framing, packet construction, CRC validation, and provides a
high-level API for controlling the wheel.
